# Laboratories http/2 request smuggling

## Lab: H2.CL request smuggling

This lab is vulnerable to request smuggling because the front-end server downgrades HTTP/2 requests even if they have an ambiguous length.

To solve the lab, perform a request smuggling attack that causes the victim's browser to load a malicious JavaScript file from the exploit server and call alert(document.cookie). The victim user accesses the home page every 10 seconds.

This lab supports HTTP/2 but doesn't advertise this via ALPN. To send HTTP/2 requests using Burp Repeater, you need to enable the Allow HTTP/2 ALPN override option and manually change the protocol to HTTP/2 using the Inspector.

Please note that this feature is only available from Burp Suite Professional / Community 2021.9.1.


This laboratory its very easy

## Lab: Response queue poisoning via H2.TE request smuggling

This lab is vulnerable to request smuggling because the front-end server downgrades HTTP/2 requests even if they have an ambiguous length.

To solve the lab, delete the user carlos by using response queue poisoning to break into the admin panel at /admin. An admin user will log in approximately every 15 seconds.

The connection to the back-end is reset every 10 requests, so don't worry if you get it into a bad state - just send a few normal requests to get a fresh connection.

Note
- Enable allow http/2 alpn override in repeater
- change protocol to http2

Solve
-------
- Delete user carlos 
- /admin log every 15 seconds
- The conecction backen is reset every 10 request . SEnd few normal request to get a fresh conection



1Âº We need send request with second request return 400 less the steal request.
2Âº When we have a valid request, we copy cookie and use for delete user carlos.
3Âº in real environments this request its posible has sent for other usert taht not is admin

## Lab: HTTP/2 request smuggling via CRLF injection

This lab is vulnerable to request smuggling because the front-end server downgrades HTTP/2 requests and fails to adequately sanitize incoming headers.

To solve the lab, use an HTTP/2-exclusive request smuggling vector to gain access to another user's account. The victim accesses the home page every 15 seconds.

If you're not familiar with Burp's exclusive features for HTTP/2 testing, please refer to the documentation for details on how to use them.

Note
- Enable allow http/2 alpn override in repeater
- change protocol to http2

To inject newlines into HTTP/2 headers, use the Inspector to drill down into the header, then press the Shift + Return keys. Note that this feature is not available when you double-click on the header.

We covered some ways you can capture other users' requests via request smuggling in a previous lab.
